        "body": "As mentioned one use for it is measuring latency. Also most other WebSocket interfaces expose the ping/pong functionality in a way like this instead of having it be handled exclusively internally by only providing an interval you can set. It would also provide easier interoperability with WebSocket implementations written for the server. **This feature would be especially useful when you are writing a client for an existing server that is not under your control.** For example when this server needs to interact with multiple different client implementations. It will likely make use of these features defined in the spec. It might also have specific requirements for clients regarding pings and pongs.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking about it a bit more I think there should also be methods for `onPing` and `sendPong` added to support all the uses cases that the spec has to offer.\r\n\r\nI think that adding this will be useful for a bunch of different use-cases but I will now explain my specific reason for requesting this feature. I realise that my reasoning for wanting this is not enough on its own but, there are a lot of other use-cases like I explained above that would greatly benefit from having this added. Also hopefully if this won't be added you might be able to give advice for this specific case that I am about to describe.\r\n\r\nReact native currently uses OkHttp for its android implementation of their 'cross platform' WebSocket api. Due to the fact that OkHttp does not expose methods for ping/pong this is also not possible to do when writing apps with react native. When looking at other implementations of WebSockets (on iOS or server implementations) this method of only being able to set a ping interval is quite unusual.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?",
